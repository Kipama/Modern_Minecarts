# ModernMinecarts

ModernMinecarts is all about rekindling your love for Minecarts.

It once again makes them a viable method of transport for players and items, while keeping a vanilla style.

Features
---
### Faster Rails: 

Constructed from Copper, these rails propel minecarts at double the speed of powered rails. 

However, beware of oxidation, which causes them to lose power over time. 

Craft them using the new smithing template discovered in mineshafts and occasionally in villages.

---
### Connecting Minecarts:

Link minecarts together using chains to transport multiple entities or large quantities of items simultaneously. 

Connects hopper minecarts to chest minecarts to join their inventories and load and unload chest minecarts automatically. 

Furnace minecarts can pull chained minecarts, and can draw fuel directly from attached minecarts' inventories.

---
### Other Rail blocks:

Rail Jump: This new rail block lets minecarts leap over gaps, as the name suggests.
Crafted with a rail and a stick, or by using a stick on a placed rail.

Rail Crossing: Not much to say here, it is an intersection, acting like a straight rail from all directions.

Powered Detector Rail: Merges the functionalities of powered and detector rails. Stop empty carts (or trains) and release them once full, or invert it to unload full minecarts.

---
### Smaller Changes:
-Removed that minecarts with players are 25% slower than empty ones. (Why is this a feature?)
